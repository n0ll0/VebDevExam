### Comment

To initialize such project I used this link:
https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html

### Examples of what to do with this project

- The web store API should have endpoints for products, customers, orders and payments.
- The products endpoint should allow the API to list, create, update and delete products. Each product should have a name, a description, a price, a category and an image URL.
- The customers endpoint should allow the API to register, login, logout and update customers. Each customer should have an email, a password, a name, an address and a phone number.
- The orders endpoint should allow the API to create, retrieve and update orders. Each order should have a customer ID, a list of product IDs, a total amount, a status and a date.
- The payments endpoint should allow the API to process payments for orders. Each payment should have an order ID, a payment method, a card number, an expiration date and a CVV code.
- The web store API should use JSON as the data format. It should also implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the data and the transactions.
